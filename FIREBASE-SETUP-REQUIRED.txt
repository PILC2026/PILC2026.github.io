🚨 REQUIRED: UPDATE FIREBASE FIRESTORE RULES 🚨
=====================================================

Your website is getting "Missing or insufficient permissions" error because
the Firestore security rules need to be updated in Firebase Console.

FOLLOW THESE STEPS EXACTLY:
---------------------------

1. Open your web browser and go to:
   https://console.firebase.google.com

2. Click on your project: "biomedix-19988"

3. In the left sidebar, click: "Firestore Database"

4. Click the "Rules" tab at the top

5. You will see an editor with current rules

6. DELETE everything in that editor

7. Copy EVERYTHING from the file "firestore-rules.txt" 
   (starting from "rules_version = '2';" line)

8. Paste it into the Firebase Console editor

9. Click the "Publish" button at the top right

10. Wait for confirmation message "Rules successfully updated"

THAT'S IT! Your registration will work after this.

=====================================================
WHY IS THIS NEEDED?
=====================================================

Firebase Firestore has security rules that control who can read/write data.
By default, it blocks all access for security.

We need to allow:
- Anyone to register (create user documents)
- Users to login (read user documents)
- Admins to approve users (update user documents)
- Admins to list all users

The rules in "firestore-rules.txt" provide these permissions.

=====================================================
AFTER UPDATING RULES:
=====================================================

1. Refresh your website
2. Try registering a new user
3. The "Missing or insufficient permissions" error will be gone!
4. Registration will work successfully
